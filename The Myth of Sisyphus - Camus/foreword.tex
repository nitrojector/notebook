\chapter*{Foreword}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Foreword}

I wish to jot down my own interpretations of this truly splendid piece of text. The concept of suicide is one that I have struggled with, and with a cursory first read, this book had provided me with a lot of answers to that question.

This set of notes will be written in the form of quotes + annotation. To say the least, it functions partially in the form of annotation for the book \textit{The Myth of Sisyphus}, which, since I have not mentioned, is a book that I recommend everyone to have a read; if you haven't already, you are missing out.

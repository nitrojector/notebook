\chapter{Coulomb's Law \& Electric Charges}

Coulomb described the interaction between charges, most readily applicable in point charges with the following relation

\[\vec{F} = k \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2} \hat{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}\]

The forces acting on different charges follows the rule of superposition, which means multiple external charges create electrostatic interaction (forces)

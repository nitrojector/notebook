\chapter{DC Circuits}

A circuit is a closed loop in which electricity can ``flow'' through. An open circuit does not allow for any flow.

As it seems, the most important thing about DC circuits at this stage is analyzing them - mostly three important variables: voltage, resistance, and current, with the addition of their change over time.

\section{Resistors (\texorpdfstring{$R$}{R})}

Resistors are elements, or resistance as a property of elements inside a circuit, is something that resists 

\section{Current (\texorpdfstring{$I$}{I})}

\section{EMF (\texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{E}$}{E})}

EMF is an element that provides an electromotive force -- this is measured in Volts. The simple statement is ``EMFs are devices that provide a potential difference of some voltage.'' I do not want to get into the details because it is a complicated concept that can be easily misunderstood, at least for me.

Test for changes.
